                            During HackMCST, I worked with a group of my friends to create the SodaFier. The SodaFier is
                            an up-and-coming soda company that has a variety of delicious flavors.
                            <br><br>
                            Flavors include Cola, Cream Soda, Ginger Ale, Grape, Oranagade, and Zesty Lime.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As for the inner workings of the SodaFier, it included a Raspberry Pi, motors, and a bunch
                            of wiring. The outside of the SodaFier had an LCD screen that would change text based on whether
                            there was a cup under the soda dispensing position. Additionally, it had a button to start
                            and stop soda dispensing.
                            <br><br>
                            My group and I started with an idea and manifested it into reality and we even placed on
                            the podium at HackMCST 2024. This project has taught me to trust in the knowledge I've
                            learned over the years and have fun.

                        <div class="rightSection-about">
                            I created the Haunted House CYOA with my good friend Nicolas. Originally, we planned on
                            creating a simple console-based program but it soon evolved into a semi-game with a custom
                            GUI.
                            <br><br>
                            The main objective is to get out of the Haunted House. To do that, the player must
                            collect equipment and defeat the boss. If the player does not collect enough equipment, the
                            boss will defeat the player. The player gets pieces of equipment by killing weak mods or if the
                            player is lucky will randomly receive one.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The thought behind this game was to create a Haunted House where you could choose your own
                            adventure. There are countless outcomes and many different ways to win.
                            <br><br>
                            Creating this game inspired me to continue my computer science journey, and it allowed me to
                            learn and improve my coding skills.

                            Encryption is essential for securing sensitive information and preventing
                            unauthorized access.
                            <br><br>
                            My CaesarCipher Encryption and Decryption Tool lets people to encrypt important
                            information with a key, preventing unwanted information leaks. When the user wants to read
                            the information again, the user can use the decryption tool to decrypt the information with
                            the key.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            My Caesar cipher also includes encryption and decryption of numbers that normal Caesar ciphers do
                            not have.

                            This project helped me step into the world of cybersecurity and broadened my understanding
                            of the topic. I hope to continue to improve my skills through meaningful projects like this.
